<h1> A Machine Learning Approach to Optimizing the Tensile Strength of Starch-Based Bioplastics </h1>
<h2> Sriaditya Vaddadi <br> Advisor: Dr. Kevin Crowthers, Ph.D. </h2>
<p> This project aims to test out multiple regression algorithms and design an algorithm that can accurately 
  predict the tensile strength of a starch-based bioplastic given a subset of the independent variables of the 
  amylose, amylopectin, and glycerol concentrations of said plastic. </p>
